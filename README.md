# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
To create a calender for the work day where the user can input events
and save it local storage in the browser.

The current day is displayed in the header and runs of the dayjs()
method and is run from the dayjs library. We save the user input
to local storage after the user inputs an event and clicks the save button.
The class .saveBtn is an array, so we loop through it and create an event
to target the area that was clicked. 

I created the renderRows function with variables to add the classes so that 
that I could create new timeblocks. I then used the the appendChild method
but received an error.

*** I was uable to complete everything in the challenge on time,
but will try to finish and re-submit at a later date ***
