# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
To create a calender for the work day where the user can input events
and save it local storage in the browser.

The current day is displayed in the header and runs of the dayjs()
method and is run from the dayjs library. We save the user input
to local storage after the user inputs an event and clicks the save button.
The class .saveBtn is an array, so we loop through it and created an event
to target the area that was clicked.
